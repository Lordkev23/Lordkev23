### My name is Kevin, I'm 28 years old and I live in Lima, Peru. I'm a Full-Stack developer passionate about technology, photography and books.
🌱 My goal is to apply my skills and knowledge to solve problems and improve people's lives through innovative and efficient applications.

🐶📱 I gained valuable experience in mobile app development using react native, team collaboration and the Scrum process as part of a team working on a mobile app for a pet adoption NGO using the Scrum methodology.

📈 I am eager to continue learning and growing.

⚡ Fun fact: I am very tall for my country of origin and people tend to look up to me... especially children who think I am an old man! :D

🚀 I study at Henry, a Bootcamp specialising in learning how to develop Web Applications. There I had the opportunity to hone my skills in key technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, React and Redux. I also took part in their teaching assistant programme. Not only did I improve my technical skills, but I also learnt valuable skills in leading and coordinating groups. As a teaching assistant, I helped students with their integration into the study group and guided them through the first steps of the course.

📷 Also have experience in other areas such as audiovisual producer, seller and I have participated in a small programming project in which a robotic arm was used.
